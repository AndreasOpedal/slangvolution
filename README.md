# Slangvolution

Note: README will be expanded when the code becomes publically available :) 

- For obtaining tweets we use `tweet_retrieval.py`, which connects to the twitter api 
- For obtaining frequency estimations of words, also using the twitter api, we use the script `save_freqs.py`
- Causal structure discovery and analysis is done in `causal_graph_learning.R`, `analyse_freqs.py` and `causal_analysis.py` 
- Code related to getting the word representations and the semantic change scores is under 
  `representations_retrieval.py`, `MLM_fine_tuning.py`, `getAPDscores.py`, 
  `semantic_change_scores.py`, `semeval_semantic_change.py`
